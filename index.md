## Natural Language Processing <span class="text-muted">{{ site.semester }}</span>

Imagine a world where you can pick up a phone and talk in English,
while at the other end of the line your words are [spoken in
Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-nlQqFCKg).  Imagine a
[computer animated representation of
yourself](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/embodied-conversational-agents)
speaking fluently what you have written in an email. Imagine a computer [writing new poetry and stories](https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3) from a prompt or [generating art 
based on descriptions](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion). Imagine
automatically uncovering protein/drug interactions in [petabytes
of medical abstracts](http://fable.chop.edu/). Imagine feeding a
computer an ancient script that no living person can read, then
listening as [the computer reads aloud in this dead
language](https://isi.edu/natural-language/mt/decipher.html).
Imagine a computer that can [do better than humans at answering
questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI-M7O_bRNg).  

Natural Language Processing is the automatic analysis of human
languages such as English, Korean, and thousands of others analyzed
by computer algorithms. Unlike artificially created programming
languages where the structure and meaning of programs is easy to
encode, human languages provide an interesting challenge, both in
terms of its analysis and the learning of language from observations.

#### Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites for this class.  However, you are expected to be familiar with the following:
* Proficiency in Python - Programming assignments will be in python (numpy and pytorch will be used).
* Calculus and Linear Algebra (MATH 151, MATH 232/240) - You will need to be comfortable with taking multivariable derivatives
* Basic Probability and Statistics (CMPT 210 or STAT 270)
* Basic Machine Learning (CMPT 410/726) is strongly recommended (Note: CMPT 410 was previously offered as CMPT 419 under the title "Machine Learning")

There will be optional TA led tutorials that will help review these topics. 

#### Textbook
* No required textbook. Online readings provided in Syllabus.
* Many of the readings will be from the following:
  * [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by [Dan Jurafsky](http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky) and [James Martin](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~martin).
  * [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf) by [Jacob Eisenstein](https://jacobeisenstein.github.io/)
  * [A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf) by Yoav Goldberg (see also [Neural Network methods for Natural Language Processing](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/10.2200/S00762ED1V01Y201703HLT037)).
