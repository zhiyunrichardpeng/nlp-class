# Final Project

<span class="text-info">Start by {{ site.hwdates[5].startdate }} or earlier</span> |
<span class="text-warning">Due on {{ site.hwdates[5].deadline }}</span>

The class project is an opportunity for you to apply your newly acquired skills in NLP towards an in-depth application and/or research problem.
Your project should aim to answer a scientific question and provide some kind of scientific knowledge gain similar to typical NLP research papers.

## Project Ideas


You should pick something you are passionate about or something you find interesting.  When selecting a project, you should make sure that you can find an well-defined dataset that you can use for your project.

Possible projects types include:
* Re-implementing / rereproducing a recent paper
* Applying an existing neural model to a new task
* Implementing a complex neural architecture
* Proposing a new neural model or a new variation of an existing model
* Proposing a new training, optimization, or evaluation scheme
* Experimental and/or theoretical analysis of a NLP model

For interesting project ideas, consider reading papers at top publishing venues for
* NLP: ACL, EMNLP, TACL, NAACL, EACL (see [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/) for many NLP publications)
* Machine learning: NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML 

You can also check out the titles of group projects from [past terms](project_titles) or final projects from [Stanford CS224n](https://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/cs224n/) for inspiration.

See [Resources](Resources) for various tools and datasets.

## Project Submission

### Project title and abstract (due on {{ site.hwdates[5].abstract }})

For your project, please submit a Title and an Abstract 
that describes what topic/problem your group will work on, the scope of the project 
and the data you plan to use.
The title/abstract is not graded, but you will receive feedback on the feasibility of the project. 

To submit, go to [{{ site.hwsubmit.name }}]({{ site.hwsubmit.url }}). Under the `Project Abstract`
activity, enter your Title and Abstract. Your abstract should
be about 250 words (please definitely use less than 1000 words).

### Project proposal (due on {{ site.hwdates[5].proposal }})

For your project proposal please submit a PDF file that describes
what problem you plan to work on, what data you will use, and the basic approach you plan to take.

The project proposal PDF should be 1-2 pages in the style of a conference (e.g. ACL/EMNLP) submission.  Your project milestone and final report should use the same template.  Links to acceptable templates are below:
* [ACL style download](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)
* [ACL style template Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)

Make sure the following points are in your proposal.

* Problem Statement and Motivation 
    * which NLP task do you plan to do; 
    * which aspect of the problem / task did your group plan to work on (accuracy, interpretability, etc.); 
    * provide some reasons for your choice
* Related Work
    * Briefly describe existing related work (with citations) and how your work relates to it.  Will your project be a re-implementation of a paper?  Will your project be an attempt to replicate a set of experiments / findings in a paper?  Will you be attempting to try something that wasn't previously tried?
* Approach 
    * Describe the algorithms and machine learning models you plan to use in your project. 
    * Using equations is not necessary but if you do, use a clear mathematical style to explain your model(s).
* Experimental setup
    * Data: which datasets you will use?  If you plan on collecting your own data, describe what data collection protocol you will follow. 
    * Implementation: How will you implement your model?  What existing code you will exploit, what will you implement yourself?
    * Evaluation: What evaluation metric will you use?
    * Comparison: What different baselines and/or variation of your approach will you compare?
* Timeline and work breakdown
    * What do you plan to achieve by the milestone?  
    * How will the work be allocated between the team members?
* Reference - provide references using BibTex 

<!-- Go to [{{ site.hwsubmit.name }}]({{ site.hwsubmit.url }}). Under the `Project Proposal`
activity submit the following files:

* `proposal.pdf`: this is the project proposal report  -->

Please upload your `proposal.pdf` to [{{site.hwdates[5].report-submit-name}}]({{site.hwdates[5].proposal-submit-url}}) `Project Proposal`.  

<!-- Go to [Canvas]({{ site.canvas }}). Under the `Project Proposal`
assignment submit your `proposal.pdf` -->


### Project milestone (due on {{ site.hwdates[5].milestone }})

For your project milestone please submit a PDF file that describes
progress you made so far on your project and plans for the remainder.
For the final write-up you will need to also submit your code, so we encourage
to get started early and submit preliminary code and results with the milestone.

The project milestone PDF should be 3-6 pages in the style of a conference (e.g. ACL/EMNLP) submission.  Your final report should use the same template.  Links to acceptable templates are below:
* [ACL style download](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)
* [ACL style template Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computational-linguistics-acl-conference/jvxskxpnznfj)

Make sure the following points are covered.
* Progress
    * What have you achieved so far?
    * Are there any issues you encountered?
* Plans
    * What are the remaining steps?
    * Do you have any plans for addressing challenges or issues?
* Data
    * What did you find out about the data so far?
* Results
    * Summary of preliminary results
    * Remaining results that you plan to produce

A good structure for the milestone report will include the following sections.  It can then also serve as a draft for your final project write-up.
* Introduction 
    * Motivate the problem, describe your goals, and highlight your findings (if you have findings)
* Related Work
    * Briefly describe existing related work (with citations) and how your work relates to it
* Approach 
    * Provide details on your main approach and baselines.  Be specific.  Make clear what part is original, what code you are writing yourself, what code you are using that is taken from elsewhere (homework, github, etc)
* Experiments 
    * Describe the **dataset** (provide some information about the data such as statistics and analysis).
    * Describe the **evaluation metrics** you will be using. 
    * Describe what experiments you plan to run and/or any results you have so far.  
    * Also provide training details, training times, etc. (if you have preliminary experiements) 
* Future Work 
    * What is your plan for the rest of the project?  
* Reference - provide references using BibTex 

Grading of the milestone will be based on the progress and the quality of writing.

### Project Write-up (due on {{ site.hwdates[5].deadline }})

You must submit your project write-up as a PDF document.
In addition you must submit a Python notebook `project.ipynb` and your source
code for your project in your Github repository:

    git@csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca:USER/nlpclass-{{ site.semcode }}-g-GROUP.git

Put all your project files into the directory `project` in your
Github repository.

Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file for your project 
so that we can use a virtual environment to run your code.

Your Python notebook must be called `project.ipynb`. 

In addition to writing code for a good project submission, the description of
what you did for your project as a PDF report is also a very important 
part of your project submission. The PDF writeup should have
the following sections and **must** cover the following information:

* Introduction 
    * Which aspect of the problem / task did your group choose to improve and reasons for your choice.
* Approach 
    * Describe the algorithms and machine learning models used in your project. Use clear mathematical notation and diagrams to explain your model(s).
* Experiments 
    * Data - What data was used? how was it used? Is there anything interesting about the data?
    * Implementation - What code did you use? Did you implement everything by yourself?  If you used homework code, which homework code you used in your project. Provide exactly which code was used in your project not written by your group (e.g. use of an aligner from an open-source project).
    * Evaluation: Describe what kind of evaluation you are doing, what metrics you are using
    * Methods being compared: which methods you are comparing against each other?
    * Results: Include a detailed comparison of different method and analysis of the results.  Did you improve over the baseline. Why or why not?
* Conclusion
    * What did you learn from your experiments?
    * What could be fixed in your approach. 
    * What you did not have time to finish, but you think would be a useful addition to your project.
* References
    * Provide references using BibTex

Please read this [guide to presenting your work](assets/cached/cs224u/cs224u-2019-presenting.pdf). Also available is a [video tutorial covering the same material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXLb4h2A724).
